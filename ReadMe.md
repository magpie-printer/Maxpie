# Maxpie
---
The Maxpie is an open source core XY 3D printer. It's mostly printed, and can largely be built of an old CR-10 that you may have already laying around. The print area is the same as an CR-10, and you can print a Maxpie on a printer as small as a Ender 3. It incorporates a P1P-style Z-axis where 3 leadscrews are driven by a single NEMA 17 stepper motor. You can use a p1p/P1s or X1 hotend for the toolhead.
